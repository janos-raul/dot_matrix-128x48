this project was made for fun and maybe some advertising but the code drives an 128x48 
pixel-led dot matrix assembly controlled by max7291 constant curent led matrix driver.
*  -using **ATMEGA 1284P** MICROCONTROLLER and **2088AS** led matrix
*  -code is written in **assmebly** language , compiled with **microchip studio**
*  -it uses simple comunication through **UART** with an **HC-05 bluetooth** serial interface for changing text and various settings
*  -reads time and date from **NEO-6M GPS** Module
*  -reads temperature with **DS18-B**
*  -using different fonts
*  mainboard:
